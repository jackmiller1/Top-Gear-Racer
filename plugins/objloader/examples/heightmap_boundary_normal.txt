heightmap boundary normal
=========================
* sometime it is interesting to establish a collision with a heightmap.
  * it is simple to build
  * it uses standard tool 
* how to establish collision ?
  * with nomanland zones (with reachable zones)
  * those zones are encoded with special wellknown numbers in the height
======================================
* how to compute the normal of the boundaries on this height map
* a boundary is a map with only 2 values, the nomanlands and the reachable zone
  * so it may be considered as a pure monochrome image with nomanlands coded as 1, 
    and reachable zones coded as 0.
======================================
# how to detect a boundary point
* it is a point which is set touching a clear point
======================================
# how to compute the normal of the boundary at one of his points
* so we aim to compute the normal on each boundary point of the heightmap
* it is precomputed, so no hard requirement on the generation time
* the normal is approximated in a square/kernel/window... e.g. 7x7 pixels
* we track the boundary edge pixel by pixel starting from our boundary point
* we do this tracking in both directions until we leave the analysis window
  * to handle the border of the heighmap, assume the tangent on the border go on
* we obtain 2 exit points. those 2 points are a segment.
  * the rotation of this segment it the rotation of the tangent at the boundary point
* the wider is the analysis window, the smoothiest is the normal estimation
======================================
# how to spread the normals of the boundary inside the nomanland
* important to be able to compute the physical reaction (rebound) at a contact point
* the boundary is the contact point
* is that actually needed to know that inside ? what about the following
  1. the potential move of an object is computed
  2. the potential resulting position is detected as being inside the nomanland
  3. from the previous position to the potential resulting position, we cast a ray
     and find the contact point (which is a boundary point)
  4. we read the normal at this boundary point
  5. so we got the impact point and the normal of the surface at this point. All what is
     needed to get
